But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head

A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face watches everytime I lie
A face that laughs everytime I fall
And watches everything

So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right beneath my skin
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside too
And your paranoia's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first
But I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is
I can't add up to what you can

Until the Sun rises up

Moving all around
Screaming of the up's and down's
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
The wheels go round
And the sunset creeps
Past the street lamps, chain-link and concrete
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn
Floats on down the street
'Till the wind is gone
The memory now is like the picture was then
When the paper's crumpled up
It can't be perfect again

From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture is there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care?

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the Sun rises up

Now, you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you

Asking you to have compassion and have some respect

And the rest of the world watching at the end of the day
In the living room laughing, like, What did he say?

Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen

In my living room watching, but I am not laughing
'Cause when it gets tense, I know what might happen
The world is cold, the bold men take action
Have to react or get blown into fractions
Ten years old, something to see
Another kid my age drugged under a Jeep
Taken and bound and found later under a tree
I wonder if he had thought the next one could be me
Do you see the soldiers that are out, today?
They brush the dust from bulletproof vests away
It's ironic, at times like this you'd pray
But a bomb blew the mosque up, yesterday
There's bombs on the buses, bikes, roads
Inside your market, your shops, your clothes
My dad, he's got a lot of fear, I know
But enough pride inside not to let that show
My brother had a book he would hold with pride
A little red cover with a broken spine
On the back, he hand-wrote a quote inside
When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die
Meanwhile, the leader just talks away
Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay
The rest of the world watching, at the end of the day
Both scared and angry, like, What did he say?

(I was born with) the hunger of a lion, the strength of a sun
I don't need to sweat it when the competition come
Original style like an 808 drum
So I don't run the track
No, I make the track run
My mom taught me words, my dad built rockets
I put 'em both together now, tell me what I got
It's a pretty smart weapon
I can shoot it, I can drop it
(But) learn to respect it 'cause you clearly can't stop it like that

Yeah, it ain't over, 'cause the sharks on the left side, the snakes on the right
And anything you do, they wanna get a little bite
It really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
'Cause once they get the teeth in, nothing really fights

Except for me, I do it like I got nothing to lose
And you can run your mouth like you could try to fill my shoes
But steady little soldier, I ain't standing next to you
I'd be laying on the ground before you're even in my view
Like that

Give me the strength of the rising sun
Give me the truth of the words unsung
And when the large bells ring, the poor men sing
"Bring me to kingdom come"

This is something for your people on the block to black out and rock to
Give you whatcha need like: "papa, who shot ya?"
Separate the weak from the obsolete, you're meek, I creep hard on imposters
And switch styles on the dime/quick witted ya'll/quit tripping
I don't have time for your crying
I grind tough, sucker, make your mind up
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the line-up?
Bang bang/little monkey man playing
With the big guns will only get you slain and I ain't playing
I'm just saying / you ain't gotta sliver of a chance
I get iller, I deliver/while you quiver in your pants
So shake shake down/money, here's the break down
You can play the bank/I'ma play the bank take down
And no mistakes now/I'm coming to getcha
I'm just a banksy/you're a brainwash, get the picture?
It's like that

We swim against the rising waves
And crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks
The early morning sings no more

So rest your head, it's time to sleep
And dream of what's in store
The body bends until it breaks
Then sings again no more

And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one

And you can't understand the fact
That it's over and done, hope you had fun
You've got a lot to discuss on the bus
Headed back where you're from

Let me say goodbye to my past life
Let me say goodbye to the darkness
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here in the starlight
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here where they love me
Tell 'em that I'm yours, this is our life
And I still keep raising the bar like
Never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
Goodbye to the stereotypes
You can't tell my kings we can't
Mandem we're linking tings in parks
Now I got a tune with Linkin Park
Like goodbye to my old hoe's
Goodbye to the cold roads
I can't die for my postcode
Young little Mike from the Gold Coast
And now I'm inside with my bro bro's
Gang

[Chester Bennington]
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye

To face my enemies

If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together

And my eyes are wide awake

For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony

They say that I don't belong
Say that I should retreat
That I'm marching to the rhythm
Of a lonesome defeat

But the sound of your voice
Puts the pain in reverse
No surrender, no illusions
And for better or worse

When they turn down the lights
I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together

Get knocked down
Pick myself up off the ground
