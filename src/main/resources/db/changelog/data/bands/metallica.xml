Better raise your ears

Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you have got some company

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four Horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die

You have been dying since the day you were born
You know it has all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once a sinner twice
No need for confession now
Cause now you have got the fight of your life

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four Horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die

Time
Has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
There is nothing you can do

So gather round young warriors now
and saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgment hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four Horsemen ride

So come on
Jump in the Fire
So come on
Jump in the Fire

With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins
The end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man

My disciples all shout to search out
And they always shall obey
Follow me now my child not the meek or the mild
But do just as I say

So come on
Jump in the Fire
So come on
Jump in the Fire

Jump by your will or be taken by force
I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit
I am stalking you as prey
Living your life as me I am you you see
There is a part of me in everyone
So reach down grab my hand walk with me through
the land
Come home where you belong

Bang your head against the stage
Like you never did before
Make it ring Make it bleed
Make it really sore
In a frenzied madness

Heads are bobbing all around
It is hot as hell tonight

Here on the stage the Marshal noise
Is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass kick your face
Exploding feeling nears
Now is the time to let it rip
To let it fuckin' loose
We are gathered here to maim and kill
Cause this is what we choose

Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac...
Here we Go!

The show is through the metal is gone
It is time to hit the road
Another town another gig
Again we will explode

Life out here is raw

We will never quit

Judas lives, recite this vow.
I've become your new god now.

Followed you from dawn of time
Whispered thoughts into your mind.
Watched your towers hit the ground
Lured your children never found
Helped your kings abuse their crown
In the heart of feeble man
Plant the seed of my own plan
The strong and powerful will fall
Find a piece of me in all‚Ä¶
Inside you all,

So, bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons

Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons

Into abyss,
You don't exist.

Throwing down a rope
A lifeline of hope
Never give you up

Listen well, better listen well
Listen well, better listen well

Don't ever speak my name
Rem–µmber, you're to blame
Keep m–µ inside, keep me inside
My name is suicide

Terrified in sleepless nights
Caught in spotlight, dead to rights
Isolate and fight your mind
Telling you you're left behind

My lying voice inside
Keeps drinking cyanide
And no more can you run
Into the Sun

Terrified, sleepless nights
Caught in spotlight, dead to rights
Isolate and fight your mind
Telling you you‚Äôre left behind

And now you speak my name
You've given back the blame
Keep me deep inside
Don't you keep me inside
Screaming suicide

Now that I'm exposed inside
Shined a light on cyanide
I'm no longer needed here
Now you've faced your biggest fear"),

Hope the blood arrives
Burn my eyes with the Sun
And pretend I'm alive

Light warming disappears
Like a cold, dead fire

Should I fall, I fall down?
Would you come, you come 'round?

Wake me
Caught in the spell I'm dreaming
Wake me
Day after day, repeating
Wake me
Sleepwalk my life away

Stagger on through the fog
In the midnight Sun
Shouting out at the shapes
Of the nameless no ones

All isn't what it seems
Cannot comprehend it
Captive inside a dream
Where the dawn won't end it

Should I fall, I fall down?
Would you come, you come 'round?
